The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.
with make command, server and client executables files are readu to be excuted. 
open 2 seperate terminals. 
in one of them. run ./server and copy the printed pid number in the terminal.
in the other one run ./client and enter pid number as an argument along with the message as 
second argument.
the server will print the message in its running terminal. 
this way 2 programs will be able to talk each other via signal function.
