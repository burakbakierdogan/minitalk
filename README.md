The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.
With the make command, server and client executables files will be ready to be executed. 

Open 2 seperate terminals. 
In one of them, run ./server and copy the printed pid number in the terminal.
In the other one, run ./client and enter pid number as an argument along with the message you would like to send to the server.
The server will print the message in its terminal. 
The aim of this project is sending Unix signals between processes. 
I convert signals to the strings.
